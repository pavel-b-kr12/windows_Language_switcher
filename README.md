# windows_Language_switcher
switch language according to ScrollLock key

## this is
the fork of <https://haali.su/winutils/>

## Difference:
* key event pass through, so you will see language stage as LEDs state
* bind to ScrollLock key only

## DOTO
* use any keys but show state with ScrollLock LED
* show state as backgrouds, windows borders or other easy and ALWAYS see elements
